## What is it? <a name="what"></a>
This is a simple little backend API themed around the usage of a social network. 


## Why did I make this? <a name="why"></a>
I mainly needed to test my own skills and methods,but figured this maybe helpful for me or others trying to set up simple applications, and desire a community interaction element.


## How did I go about building this? <a name="how"></a>
This was rather an awkward learning curve for me as I was getting use to the routing syntax before ES6 came out. That being said, I used ExpressJs and Mongoose, and a good chunk of javascript to create this little do-dad.
